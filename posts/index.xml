      <description>You may have seen this recent headline from the South China Morning Post
This was passed around widely as a troubling sign
This is very worrisome. Among recovered former #COVID19 cases, ‚Äúnearly a third had unexpectedly low levels of antibodies. In some cases, antibodies could not be detected at all.‚Äù ü§î https://t.co/VEwTJWOJD2
&amp;mdash; Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) April 8, 2020  However, &amp;ldquo;worrisome&amp;rdquo; was not even a good read of the results</description>

      <title>Speaking Moistly: A new study investigates whether SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted via speech droplets</title>

      <description>Researchers from the NIH and the University of Pennsylvania have put up a preprint titled Could SARS-CoV-2 be transmitted via speech droplets?
They write
 Considering that reports of asymptomatic transmission account for 50-80% of COVID-19 cases, droplet emission while speaking could be a significant factor driving transmission.
 They point to the high upper respiratory viral loads that have been documented elsewhere to support this idea.
Using laser light-scattering, they recorded the number of expelled droplets detected when volunteers said &amp;lsquo;stay healthy&amp;rsquo; 3 times in a row.</description>

      <description>In a new paper, Colorado researchers look at the possibility of a correlation between Covid and air temperature.
Looking at WHO case reports and building statistical models, they find
 significant reduction of case rates with mean maximum temperature above approximately 22.5 C or 72.5 F
 In the figure below the x-axis shows the mean temperature while the red bars show case count vs the dashed line which shows total population in that mean temperature bin</description>

      <title>Key findings from the largest ICU case study to date, just released: 1591 Covid Patients in Lombardy</title>

      <description>A study was just published describing 1591 ICU Covid patients in Lombardy, Italy, the largest study of its kind so far.
Annotations by @PulmCrit
Some key stats:
 82% of the patients were male median age was 63 years 68% had at least one comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common 88% of the patients for which there was this kind of data were intubated (1150 total) 58% remain in the ICU 16% have been discharged from the ICU 26% died during the study median length of stay of those who died in the ICU was 7 days median length of stay for those who were discharged from the ICU was 8 days  @PulmCrit speculates about metabolic syndrome comorbidities</description>

      <title>New analysis estimates hidden spread in Washington state in January and February</title>

      <description>Trevor Bedford and 55 colleagues just published a preprint detailing some detective work on early transmission of Covid in Washington state.
The TL;DR is they looked at 346 viral genomes from infected patients and said the data are
 strongly suggesting cryptic spread of COVID-19during the months of January and February 2020, before active community surveillance was implemented.
 How they can know Bedford describes the way this detective work is done in a blog post but the gist is that viruses mutate all the time (often in ways that don&amp;rsquo;t effect function).</description>

      <title>Whats the Deal with Hydroxychloroquine? The current state of scientific knowledge.</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look at what the science says today about Hydroxychloroquine or HCQ.
A recent letter in the Annals of Internal Medicine offers a TL;DR
 Data to support the use of HCQ and CQ for COVID-19 are limited and inconclusive.
 The French Study If you&amp;rsquo;ve heard anything at all about HCQ, it&amp;rsquo;s probably in some way related to this French study which came out without peer review in mid March.</description>
