<p><img src="/images/32227200-fig1.png" /></p>
<p>For <strong>hospital nurses</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Among the nation’s nearly 2 million registered nurses employed in hospitals, an estimated 370 000 (19%) are aged 55 to 64 years, and an estimated 55,000 (3%) are aged 65 years or older and thus, at even greater risk of complications and mortality from COVID-19.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For <strong>Non-hospital nurses</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of the approximately 1.2 million registered nurses employed outside of hospital settings, who could be called in to assist as hospital needs increase, even higher percentages are aged 55 to 64 years (24%) or aged 65 years or older (5%).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Physicians even older</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The physician workforce is older still; of the approximately 1.2 million physicians in the United States, an estimated 230,000 (20%) are aged 55 to 64 years and an estimated 106,000 (9%) are aged 65 years or older.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors also estimate that some of the harder hit regions actually skew even older.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although areas with relatively older registered nurses do not necessarily have relatively older physicians, Camden, New Jersey, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Orange County, California, are among the top 5 areas with the oldest registered nurse and physician workforces.</p>
