      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look at what the science says today about Hydroxychloroquine or HCQ.
A recent letter in the Annals of Internal Medicine offers a TL;DR
 Data to support the use of HCQ and CQ for COVID-19 are limited and inconclusive.
 The French Study If you&amp;rsquo;ve heard anything at all about HCQ, it&amp;rsquo;s probably in some way related to this French study which came out without peer review in mid March.</description>

      <description>I am an American with an MS in bioinformatics who has been following the Coronavirus outbreak since January.
My goal is to post digestible summaries of academic papers on COVID-19, along with some curated expert commentary.
Long term, I plan to keep an up-to-date dashboard of the current state of knowledge about the virus itself, the disease it causes, the public health response, and treatments and diagnostics coming out of the scientific literature.</description>
