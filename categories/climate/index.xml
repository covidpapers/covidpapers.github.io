      <description>In a new paper, Colorado researchers look at the possibility of a correlation between Covid and air temperature.
Looking at WHO case reports and building statistical models, they find

 In the figure below the x-axis shows the mean temperature while the red bars show case count vs the dashed line which shows total population in that mean temperature bin</description>
