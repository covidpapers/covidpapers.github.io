      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve long known that asymptomatic transmission was a thing and recently learned that pre-symptomatic viral loads are very high. A new preprint titled Suppression of COVID-19 outbreak in the municipality of Vo, Italy
A TL;DR below, but the big takeaway is that there was no significant difference in viral load between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients
ðŸ”¥ Important (pre-print) study from Voâ€™, a small town in ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, where most residents were tested (86% in 1st, 71% in 2nd survey)</description>

      <description>A study on viral shedding and transmissability was publshed in Nature today.
A couple of TL;DRs
Study of viral shedding in 94 #COVID19 cases, finding that infectiousness peaked up to 2 days before symptom onset, and that 44% of secondary cases were infected when the index cases were pre-symptomatic. Active case-finding crucial. #SARSCoV2 #HCoV19 https://t.co/AjUnmMU1nR

      <description>Researchers from the NIH and the University of Pennsylvania have put up a preprint titled Could SARS-CoV-2 be transmitted via speech droplets?
They write
 Considering that reports of asymptomatic transmission account for 50-80% of COVID-19 cases, droplet emission while speaking could be a significant factor driving transmission.
 They point to the high upper respiratory viral loads that have been documented elsewhere to support this idea.
Using laser light-scattering, they recorded the number of expelled droplets detected when volunteers said &amp;lsquo;stay healthy&amp;rsquo; 3 times in a row.</description>
