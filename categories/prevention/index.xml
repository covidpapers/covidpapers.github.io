      <description>Researchers from the NIH and the University of Pennsylvania have put up a preprint titled Could SARS-CoV-2 be transmitted via speech droplets?
They write
 Considering that reports of asymptomatic transmission account for 50-80% of COVID-19 cases, droplet emission while speaking could be a significant factor driving transmission.
 They point to the high upper respiratory viral loads that have been documented elsewhere to support this idea.
Using laser light-scattering, they recorded the number of expelled droplets detected when volunteers said &amp;lsquo;stay healthy&amp;rsquo; 3 times in a row.</description>
