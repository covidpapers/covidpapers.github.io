      <description>You probably saw the headline
related to a recent preprint. The conclusion that many have drawn is that we can conclude that COVID-19 is far less deadly than believed. However, the study is flawed in many ways.
Stanford Serology study preprint just posted that is certain to mislead many people:https://t.co/eitVtfjYoP
It&amp;#39;s a serological study, which is fantastic. We need these kinds of studies and data badly. Unfortunately this paper is badly misleading (bordering on purposeful?</description>

Annotations by @PulmCrit
Some key stats:
 82% of the patients were male median age was 63 years 68% had at least one comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common 88% of the patients for which there was this kind of data were intubated (1150 total) 58% remain in the ICU 16% have been discharged from the ICU 26% died during the study median length of stay of those who died in the ICU was 7 days median length of stay for those who were discharged from the ICU was 8 days  @PulmCrit speculates about metabolic syndrome comorbidities</description>

      <description>Trevor Bedford and 55 colleagues just published a preprint detailing some detective work on early transmission of Covid in Washington state.
The TL;DR is they looked at 346 viral genomes from infected patients and said the data are
 strongly suggesting cryptic spread of COVID-19during the months of January and February 2020, before active community surveillance was implemented.
 How they can know Bedford describes the way this detective work is done in a blog post but the gist is that viruses mutate all the time (often in ways that don&amp;rsquo;t effect function).</description>
